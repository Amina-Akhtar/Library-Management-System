# Library-Management-System
This Library Management System caters to two actors - students and librarians. This system enable students to read books online, borrow and return books. Librarians have administrative access to add and remove books efficiently. Additionally, the system provides a feature through which students can recommend books to be added which are currently unavailable in the library.
