# Library-Management-System
This Library Management System caters to two actors - students and librarians. This system will enable students to read books online, borrow and return books. Librarians will have administrative access to add and remove books efficiently. Additionally, the system will provide a feature through which students can recommend books which are unavailable in the library.
